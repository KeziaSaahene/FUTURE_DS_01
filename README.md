# FUTURE_DS_O1 â€” Social Media Trend Analysis Dashboard

This project was created as part of **Task 1** for my **Data Science internship with Future Interns**.

It combines **Python** (for data preparation and sentiment analysis) with **Power BI** (for interactive dashboard visualization), aimed at uncovering insights into social media engagement and sentiment trends.

## Project Overview

The goal was to analyze social media data from platforms like **Twitter**, **Instagram**, and **Facebook**, classify user sentiments using **natural language processing**, and present the insights in a clear, visual format.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, TextBlob)
- **Power BI**
- **CSV files** for data storage and transformation

---

## Python Workflow

1. **Loaded raw sentiment data** from a CSV file.
2. **Applied TextBlob** to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
3. **Created a new column** `sentiment_class` with the categorized sentiment labels.
4. **Exported the cleaned dataset** (`sentiment_df.csv`) for dashboard use in Power BI.
